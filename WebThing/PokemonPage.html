				All the games in the pokemon franchise are good. The first reason is that 
				there are so many characters. In total there are 932, with some debate on 
				being even higher. Secondly, type advantages are a huge part. There are 18 
				different types that can have any number of combinations, giving each pokemon 
				strengths and weaknesses, giving the game a unique strategy. Items are a huge 
				part of the game. They can give you the edge over a more powerful opponent, or 
				be what loses the match, so a set to match the pokemon is essential.  Moves are 
				one of the biggest parts. They can differ from being status effects hindering 
				the opponent, or sheer base power to destroy your foes. Stats are also very 
				important. Almost everything you do to a pokemon should complement their stats. 
				If you want a meat shield, pump up defence and sp defence, or speed to always go 
				first, or for attack power attack and sp attack. Shinies are also a very interesting 
				mechanic. These pokemon have a different color scheme and are super rare. This means they are 
				highly sought after, and would impress a lot of your friends. With the latest game, there is also dynamaxing. 
				If you love giant monster movies, then youâ€™ll love this. The pokemon are called back, and 
				then the supersize, standing at the height of buildings, and use moves powerful enough to change the terrain, and 
				destroy the opposition. There is just so many reasons to love the game, and no reason not to try it.

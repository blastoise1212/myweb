				Super smash bros is one of the greatest games ever. The characters are all 
				very fun to play and unique. For each character a combination of  moves, 
				weight, speed, and jump all contribute to a unique fighter, and way to  play. 
				The characters in the game are from all over Nintendo’s massive history of game 
				making. There’s metroid, pokemon, mario, and so much more. There is also play styles 
				that need to be mentioned. Some people love to rush into the action and smash some heads. 
				Others like to use the opponents moves against them, and are more patient. Then there 
				is people who love to throw tons of projectiles. Also many of the characters are suited 
				for a style of play, like bowser for brawling, greninja for the counters, and young 
				link to pepper opponents with projectiles. Campaign mode is probably one of 
				the most fun ways to play. In it you battle evil versions of the cast of SSB. 
				you also unlock spirits of various other nintendo characters to power you up, 
				and give you special abilities. Amiibos are also a very fun way to play. Not only 
				can they play idle for you, but they start to learn from battling people, and learn 
				how counter them. Also at a certain level, these amiibos are almost impossible to beat 
				by even the person who trained it. Tournaments are amazing in Smash. They are competitive, 
				diverse, and a lot of fun. Also, this means you don’t need someone in the room to play with 
				them. In SSB there is something for everyone and a massive fan base to prove it.
